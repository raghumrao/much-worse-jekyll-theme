I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.vt.edu/) from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). Prior to this, I was affiliated with the [Wireless@VT Research Group](https://wireless.vt.edu/), advised by [Dr. Jeffrey H. Reed](https://reed.wireless.vt.edu/) and [Dr. Vuk Marojevic](https://sites.google.com/view/vuk-marojevic). I have a strong experience in undertaking research on fundamental as well as practical aspects of wireless communications. I have made several research contributions in the areas of 4G/5G PHY layer security, flexible cellular PHY layer protocol design, and coexistence of 5G/beyond-5G cellular networks with other wireless technologies. 

## Current Research Interests
1. Spectrum sharing
2. PHY layer security
3. Vehicular and UAV communications
4. Beyond-5G Cellular Systems
