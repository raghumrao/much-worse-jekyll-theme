I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in [Electrical Engineering](https://ece.vt.edu/) from [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/). Prior to this, I was affiliated with the [Wireless@VT Research Group](https://wireless.vt.edu/), under the advisement of [Dr. Jeffrey H. Reed](https://reed.wireless.vt.edu/) and [Dr. Vuk Marojevic](https://sites.google.com/view/vuk-marojevic). During the course of my academic research, I have made fundamental and practical contributions to 4G/5G physical layer security, radar-cellular spectrum sharing and vehicular communications. 

## Current Research Interests
1. Spectrum sharing
2. Cellular PHY layer security
3. Vehicular and UAV communications
4. Localization
